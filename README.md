## Repository

* <https://github.com/akiko-pusu/redmine_issue_templates>

## Plugin installation

1. Copy the plugin directory into the $REDMINE_ROOT/plugins directory. Please
    note that plugin's folder name should be "redmine_issue_templates". If
    changed, some migration task will be failed.
2. Do migration task.

    e.g. rails redmine:plugins:migrate RAILS_ENV=production

3. (Re)Start Redmine.

## Uninstall

Try this:

* rails redmine:plugins:migrate NAME=redmine_issue_templates VERSION=0
    RAILS_ENV=production

### When migration error

If the migration is cancelled with the error like following message for the first time you try to install this plugin:

> Caused by: Mysql2::Error: Table 'DATABASE_FOR_REDMINE.issue_templates' doesn't exist

You can fix this error to remove migration records related to this plugin from shema_migrations table.

If you can access and select database for Redmine, try this command:

```sql
select * from schema_migrations where version like '%redmine_issue_templates%';
```

If there are any records shown like this and there is no table named 'issue_templates', your installation has been incomplete state.

```sql
1-redmine_issue_templates
2-redmine_issue_templates
```

So, you should better to uninstall task first, and retry the migration.

If you have not created any template records yet, and hope to uninstall and re-install this plugin, please see README.

**Uninstall:**

```ruby
rails db:migrate_plugins NAME=redmine_issue_templates VERSION=0 RAILS_ENV=production
```

After that, records of migration are removed from schema_migrations table.

**Re-install:**

```ruby
rails db:migrate_plugins NAME=redmine_issue_templates RAILS_ENV=production (for Redmine4.x)
```
